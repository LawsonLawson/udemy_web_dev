<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a dedicated and passionate student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mobile Computing at the
  University of Ghana. With a strong foundation in software engineering principles, I enjoy exploring how technology
  can be applied to solve real-world problems. My academic journey has equipped me with knowledge in programming,
  computer systems, mathematics, and emerging technologies, while also giving me the opportunity to apply theory through
  practical projects.</p>

<p>CDuring my studies, I have worked on diverse projects, including building a Simple Shell in C, which deepened my
  understanding of operating systems, processes, and system-level programming. I also collaborated with a team on GiveAid,
  a donations platform built with Django, where I gained valuable experience in backend development, teamwork, and delivering
  functional solutions. These projects have strengthened my problem-solving skills and sparked my growing interest in backend
  development for mobile and web applications.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, my goal is to become a well-rounded software engineer specializing in backend systems and mobile app development.
  I am eager to learn new technologies, contribute to impactful projects, and continuously grow as a developer. Beyond academics,
  I am driven by curiosity, persistence, and a passion for building tools that make life better for people.</p>
