<h1>The Best Movies According to Israel</h2>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Jumong</h3>
<p>Aired May 15th, 2006 -- originally scheduled for 60 episodes yet ended up with 81 due to how good it was.<br />A very good plot with an excellent cast.</p>

<h3>Game Of Thrones</h3>
<p>A lot of controversy about how it ended but in my opinion, it was so good to the point where viewers couldn't handle that it just had to come to an end one way or the other.<br />That being said, the White Walkers didn't deserve to be taken out like they did tho.</p>

<h3>When They See Us</h3>
<p>Looking for something you can finish watching in one sitting but do not really have hours to spare? this one right here is HIM!...<br />With just 4 episodes, it does the trick!</p>
